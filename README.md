# ECMAScript Nano Libs

This repository contains numerous small utility packages. These packages serve various useful purposes and are written in nano ESModule without any dependencies.

Here is a brief overview of the included libraries:

1. [`tsconfig-base`](./packages/tsconfig-base#readme): This is a foundational TypeScript configuration used for Alwatr projects.
2. [`flat-string`](./packages/flat-string#readme): The `flat-string` function flattens the underlying C structures of a concatenated JavaScript string.
3. [`global-scope`](./packages/global-scope#readme): This TypeScript module provides a cross-platform alternative to `globalThis` named `globalScope`. This object works across different environments, including browsers (`window`), Node.js (`global`), and Web Workers (`self`).
4. [`platform-info`](./packages/platform-info#readme): This module offers a method to identify the current platform where the script is being executed. It defines a `platformInfo` constant that contains details about the current platform.
5. [`prettier-config`](./packages/prettier-config#readme): These are Alwatr's shared configurations for Prettier.
6. [`eslint-config`](./packages/eslint-config#readme): This is Alwatr's ECMAScript Style Guide presented as shareable ESLint configurations.
7. [`deep-clone`](./packages/deep-clone#readme): This function allows you to clone deeply nested objects and arrays in JavaScript.
8. [`nano-build`](./packages/nano-build#readme): This is a tool for building/bundling ECMAScript, TypeScript, and JavaScript libraries. It's user-friendly, requires no setup, follows best practices, has no dependencies, and uses esbuild for improved performance.
9. [`type-helper`](./packages/type-helper#readme): Collection of useful typescript type helpers.
10. [`wait`](./packages/wait#readme): Comprehensive toolkit for managing asynchronous operations.
11. [`exit-hook`](./packages/exit-hook#readme): A utility for registering exit handlers in Node.js.
12. [`flatomise`](./packages/flatomise#readme): A utility for creating promises that can be externally resolved or rejected.
13. [`async-queue`](./packages/async-queue#readme): A queue that executes async tasks in order like mutex and semaphore methodology for javascript and typescript.
14. [`node-fs`](./packages/node-fs#readme): Enhanced file system operations in Node.js, including reading, writing, and handling JSON files, with both synchronous and asynchronous options.
15. [`is-number`](./packages/is-number#readme): A simple utility to check if a value is a number.
16. [`parse-duration`](./packages/parse-duration#readme): A simple utility to parse a duration string into milliseconds number.
17. [`local-storage`](./packages/local-storage#readme): `localJsonStorage` is a utility object in our TypeScript package that provides methods for interacting with the local storage in a structured and versioned manner.
18. [`polyfill-has-own`](./packages/polyfill-has-own#readme): A polyfill for `Object.hasOwn`.
19. [`fetch`](./packages/fetch/README.md): Enhanced fetch API with cache strategy, retry pattern, timeout, helper methods and enhanced types.
